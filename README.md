### Objective: 

Develop a simple neural network model using Keras library and predict the likelihood of customer accepting the loan that was offered to them by the bank.

the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (PersonalLoan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.
